            <li>He was a creative songwriter, with more than 4,000 songs to his acclaim including Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs that are popular pieces, which many consider to be immortal.</li>
            <li>He could not play instruments for long because he injured his arm while climbing a tree. In the meantime, Celerio temporarily worked as a comic illustrator.</li>
            <li>Aside from being a musician, Celerio was also a poet and a film actor who appeared in various Philippine films of the 1950s and 1960s</li>

        <h1>Ang Pipit</h1>
        <p>"Ang Pipit" (The Pipit) is a beloved Filipino folk song that narrates the tale of a bird recognized in Tagalog as
            a pipit, belonging to the Motacillidae family. This song unfolds the sad reality lived by Filipinos who remain
            captured in their own home country. Interestingly, some Filipinos may not be aware that "pipit" is also an English
            term. Consequently, there's a tendency to translate the title into English as "My Sparrow."
        </p>
        <h1>Cover Versions / Interpretations</h1>
        <p>Given the poignant and melancholic theme of this folk song, there exists a
            certain incongruity with contemporary sensibilities when one observes that
            the prevailing interpretations of the melody are decidedly upbeat. It's akin
            to joyfully mocking a vulnerable being caught in the depths of agony.
